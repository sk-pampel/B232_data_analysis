Contributing to ARC
===================

Contributions to ARC are very welcome! Before you start coding, [please check this page](https://arc-alkali-rydberg-calculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html)
for a few notes on some ideas for development, how to start, and naming conventions, so that we can minimize efforts on both sides.
Don't hesitate to open issue to ask questions and discuss ideas and suggestions.
